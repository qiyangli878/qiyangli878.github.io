I am a Master's student in Computer Engineering at the **National University of Singapore (NUS)**, starting in January 2026. 

Previously, I worked as an Algorithm Engineer at **Baidu** (2024.11 - 2026.01), where I was a core member of the team responsible for training large-scale foundation models. My work focused on:
- **Large Language Model Training**: Conducted full-parameter training of 100B+ models on large-scale clusters (768 H800 GPUs).
- **Post-Training**: Developed and optimized pipelines for SFT and RLHF (PPO/GRPO/DPO), including online distillation and reward modeling.
- **Data Engineering**: Built high-quality instruction tuning datasets using automated pipelines and LLM-based evaluation.

Before joining Baidu, I was an Algorithm Intern at the **Institute for AI Industry Research (AIR), Tsinghua University**, working on dynamic attention mechanisms for LLMs.

I received my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from **Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)** in 2024, where I was recognized with multiple scholarships and awards for academic excellence.

My research interests lie in Large Language Models, Distributed Training, and Efficient Inference.
